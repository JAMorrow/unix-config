# Unix Configs

My personal Emacs, bash, fish, and whatever else configurations.  Feel free to snag as you will.

I put these in a repository because I am attempting to sync across computers.

## TODO
* Reorg folders.
* Script to setup soft links would be excellent
* Need a way to setup different Emacs configs--I install Emacs 26 snapshot where I can, but that's not available on work computers.  Probably option for the aforementioned script.
* Add i3 config.
